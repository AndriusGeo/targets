# Targets

A mobile app to locate the Target stores nearest you. Made in HTML5 + PhoneGap

To see the web version running live, go to: http://timanglade.github.com/targets/www/index.html

The entire app is contained in www/index.html (all the HTML & JS is in there), but the project will also work fine on your iOS mobile device using Cordova / PhoneGap. Just clone the repo, double-click the xcodeproj and build.
